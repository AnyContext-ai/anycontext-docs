# Debugging with MCP Inspector

[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is an open-source tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. This tutorial will show you how to install MCP inspector and connect to an MCP server hosted on AnyContext.

## Installing MCP Inspector

1. The recommended way to install MCP inspector is using npm. If you havent already got node and npm installed, you can follow the guide from [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
2. Open a terminal, and run the command: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`. On success, you will see an output like this:
    ```
    Starting MCP inspector...

    ```

## Inspecting an MCP server
