# Introduction

LLM-powered applications like ChatGPT, Claude, and Zed greatly increases productivity. However, they lack access to the services and data that are crucial to your business.

AnyContext bridges the gap between your LLM-powered applications and the context of your business. AnyContext makes it easy to connect your LLM-powered applications to:

- External Services like GitHub, Slack, or search engines.

- Databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

- Any data exposed through a web API. All you have to do is provide the API documentation, and AnyContext handles the rest.

- Common building blocks for agents such as code interpreters, browser automation tools and memory management.

Simply put, AnyContext provides **Context as a Service** to your LLM-powered applications.
